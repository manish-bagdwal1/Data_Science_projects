 ##  2.**Title**
 #### Brain tumor MRI

 - A Brain tumor is considered as one of the **aggressive diseases**, among children and adults. 
 
 - Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary **Central Nervous System(CNS)** tumors. 
 
 -  Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor.

## 3. **Motivation**

 - The best technique to detect brain tumors is **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**. 
 
 -  A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. 
 
 -  A **manual** examination can be **error-prone** due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.  
 
 -  Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and **Artificial Intelligence(AI)** has consistently shown **higher accuracy** than manual classification.

## 4. **Goal**

 - Brain Tumors are complex. There are a lot of **abnormalities** in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s).  
 
 - This makes it really difficult for complete understanding of the nature of the tumor.
 
 -  Also, a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis.
 
 -   Often times in developing countries the **lack of skillful doctors** and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRIâ€™. 
 
 - So an **automated system** on Cloud can solve this problem.

## 5. **Data**
- The datset is in form of zip file having two folders training and testing.
- The dataset contain 3264 sample images
- There 4 class of tumors:
  0 - **Glioma Tumor**<br>
  1 - **No Tumor**<br>
  2 - **Meningioma Tumor**<br>
  3 - **Pituitary Tumor**<br>
